<p>We are excited to host a challenge based on <a href="https://generallyintelligent.ai/avalon/">Avalon</a>, our benchmark for reinforcement learning based on procedurally generated worlds. Agents in Avalon must accomplish a wide range of tasks, all with the same sparse reward structure. Different tasks correspond to randomly generated worlds that require that skill.</p>

<p>Avalon is unique among existing RL benchmarks in that the reward function, world dynamics, and action space are the same for every task, with tasks differentiated solely by altering the environment; its 20 tasks, ranging in complexity from eat and throw to hunt and navigate, each create worlds in which the agent must perform specific skills in order to survive. We find that standard RL baselines make progress on most tasks but are still far from human performance, suggesting Avalon is challenging enough to advance the quest for generalizable RL.</p>

<p>In this contest, you will develop your own agent for the Avalon environment. You may use any algorithm you wish, as long as your agent conforms to the observation and action space that we have specified. Good luck!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://generallyintelligent.ai/avalon/">this page</a> for instructions on how to get started and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13417">our paper</a> for technical details.</p>
